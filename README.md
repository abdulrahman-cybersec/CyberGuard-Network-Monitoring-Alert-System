## 🚀 Key Features
- **Real-Time Dashboard** for simulated network activity  
- **Custom Alerting Engine** (threshold-based + behavior-anomaly triggers)  
- **Visual Metric Charts** (traffic, CPU, memory, failed logins, etc.)  
- **Safe Data Simulator** that generates attack-like and normal traffic  
- **Modular Architecture** — easy to expand and customize  
- **Beginner-safe, SOC-friendly environment** for practice
