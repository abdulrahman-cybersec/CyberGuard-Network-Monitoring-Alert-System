CyberGuard (N-MAS) — Scholarship description (copy into application):

I developed CyberGuard, a safe Network Monitoring & Alert System prototype, to demonstrate my practical understanding of network metrics, threshold-based alerting, and full-stack prototyping. The system includes a data simulator that produces realistic demonstration data without interacting with external networks. This project highlights my readiness for advanced cybersecurity study and my commitment to ethical practice.
